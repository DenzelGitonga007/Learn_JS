DOM - Document Object Model 

Find elements → e.g., document.getElementById("myBtn")

Change content → element.textContent = "Hello!"

Change style → element.style.color = "red"

React to events → when a user clicks, types, or hovers

Basically, DOM is the bridge between HTML/CSS (the structure & style) and JavaScript (the behavior).
